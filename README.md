UFLDL Tutorial Solutions
========================

Solutions to all the exercises of the [UFLDL Tutorial] about Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning.

The dataset used in the exercises need to be downloaded, but there will be links to it in each exercise's folder. One exception is the extensively used [MNIST dataset], which need to be downloaded in the folder [utils/mnist], but there are instructions there too.

Also, you must run first the `set_search_path.m` script, so that the exercises scripts know where to look for the functions.
